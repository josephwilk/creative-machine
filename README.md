* P-creativity (psychological) - individual comes up with an idea that they have never thought of before
* H-creativity (historical)    - nobody else has ever come up with this idea before

Conditions of Creativity:
* idea must have some value

Novelty:
>a novel idea is one that did not occur before, but has been reached by an existing set of generative rules.

Creativity:
> a creative idea is one that could not occur before.
